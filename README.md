# Amaxa Visual Studio Code Extension

This extension, in early development, adds the commands "Amaxa: Run Load" and "Amaxa: Run Extraction" to Visual Studio Code. Each command will prompt you to select an operation definition (a YAML file) and supply the name of a Salesforce DX scratch org. It will then invoke Amaxa for you and display the results in the Output pane.
